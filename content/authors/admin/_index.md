I am a machine learning enthusiast with a strong background in bioinformatics and experience in industrial research. My interests include uncertainty estimation, representation learning, and trustworthy ML. I have a passion for reading state-of-the-art ML research papers and discovering the math behind the methods. With a degree in bioinformatics and experience in computer vision and natural language processing, I have been actively coding for the past 5 years. 

I am excited to share my knowledge and experience on this website. Thank you for visiting!
